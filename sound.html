<h2> About My Soundscape </h2>
<p>  I think about my years at Pitt and feel that it can best be described through the sounds of a Pittsburgh diner.  I spent many mornings in diners, ordering classics like milkshakes, burgers, and, of course, fries.  It was always the most relaxing time of my week, even though my stomach always made me pay for the diner food later.  I want the listeners to feel the kind of warmth and comfort I felt while eating in my favorite spots around Pittsburgh. In this soundscape, I tried to capture a diner on a Sunday morning.  The introduction brings you into the world of a regular diner-goer.  The door opens, the bell rings, and the jukebox shuffles making you feel right at home.  I wanted the rhythm of the diner and its natural flow to take over as the soundscape went on.  The beat starts very subtly and builds from there.  I wanted it to feel like getting lost in a daydream and then the crash of plates is the break in the daydream and return to reality. I think with life moving so fast itâ€™s nice to get caught up in a daydream and the rhythm of people around you.

  This was a very difficult sound to capture for me.  I do not have much editing experience, so it took me awhile to establish the beat.  I used a lot of different sounds from various sources.  I used a lot of prerecorded sounds, but also included a few self-recorded tracks to make it more personal.  One of the crashes is my roommates and I breaking a few plates, and another is us tapping on our dishes.  I also recorded the laughter of my boyfriend and I that you can hear in the beginning of the soundscape.  This was a very personal soundscape to me, so I wanted to include elements that most made me feel like I do when I am in those diners.  The process cut a lot of sounds into pieces.  For the second chunk of door squeak, I used the effect fade out.  I then faded in and a bunch of different noises that you might hear at a restaurant.  Including a busy restaurant noise and plates clattering.  For the main beat I cut up a lot of normal sounds you would hear at a diner and arranged them into a beat, for this I used the repeat tool a lot.  I included sounds like forks being raddled, a kettle whistling, pots banging, vegetables being chopped, and water being poured.  Then I added the big crash of the plates followed by the plate roll.  I wanted to add an element of humor into my soundscape.  The awkward plate roll followed by the prolonged silence and then people returning to talking.  Then the outro you hear the protagonist leave and the door shut behind them.  For the sounds that I recorded myself I used the noise reduction tool for the laugh and for the big crash.  I also used pitch change for the plate tapping I recorded myself to get the right sound.  I also used the change tempo tool for the main tapping sound I used throughout the soundscape.  This help shape my desired beat.  For the screen shots, I included the building of the beat that shows how I introduced each sound one at a time.  Then I included the big crash because this is the sort of climax of my soundscape. I also included a screenshot of the busy restaurant noise I used fading in and out.  This was a key component to my soundscape because its present right before the listener gets lost in the daydream and then again after the crash. Finally, I included a screenshot of the laugh audio to show where I included my more personal element.  I think overall I worked very hard on this soundscape to piece together a coherent message and sound.
