<h2> About my Visual Argument </h2>
<p> For my visual argument I wanted to create a flyer to educate people on the issue of food waste in America.  For this project, I first wanted to introduce that food waste was a problem.  I did this by first creating a pie chart and using pies as the background for the pie chart.  I wanted this portion of the flyer to have some visual punning and layout the issue at hand.  I purposely chose the contrast of the red and the other bright colors to divide the flyer into two parts.  I also purposely made the size of the tips part bigger because I overall wanted the flyer to have a more positive message.  I also considered size when choosing text because I wanted there to be brief catchy headers along with more description in the captions for the tips on reducing food waste.  Also, the arrangement of the tips was also important because I wanted to arrange it in a way that would have your eye flow from one element to the next. It was pointed out to me that the design might appeal to a younger audience than I had first imagined.  I think that this flyer appears to maybe younger kids.  It is still important that they learn about food waste and start building habits to combat that now.  I think the bright colors, illustrations, and simplistic captions make it comprehensible for anyone.  I also was told that the arrangement of the text was slightly off in some places in my draft.  Overall, I think this visual argument could build good habits for the future generation to come and it could also be used by anyone.  This is just to get people started thinking about this issue and what small changes could have a big impact. For the creation of this project, I added a lot of layers and used a lot of tools in Gimp to create it.  I used tools like paste, bucket fill, cut, text, transparency, copy layer, scale layer, filter, and many others.  This took a lot of time, and I am pleased with the final product.</p>
