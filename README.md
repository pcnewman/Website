# Website
website for composing digital media
For my website, I wanted to create a portfolio to display all the work I have accomplished in my Composing Digital Media class. 
I have a welcome page to introduce my site and then also an about me page so user's can get to know a little more about me. 
I then created pages for both my projects, my soundscape and visual argument. I also wanted to make my website clean and simple.  
I therefore placed my sources on a separate page to not detract from the actual projects themselves.  
Also a goal I had for myself was to make it easy to navigate.  Thats why I included the dropdown menu with my projects and then their sources.
I also included the buttons on the project pages for my sources for easy navigation.  One of my favorite features of my website is the hover on all the button.
This was quite time consuming to get all of that to work so I was really proud when it was all complete.
I also created an extra fun feature on my website with a bunch of pictures of my dogs.  Its under the projects page and there is a button that navigates you to the page.
Overall, I really enjoyed creating this website and am proud to share it with everyone.
