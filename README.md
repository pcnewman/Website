# Website
For this intial submission I wanted to make sure I had the foundation of the website laid out.  
I have all my pages constructed and linked and included grid format in each.
I also wanted to make sure I had all of my basic things I needed for the visual argument and soundscape along with descriptions for each.
I also wanted to put an about me that I will probably add additional information to later.
I also will probably change the colors of the website and hopefully add some more design elements.  I also will probably add additional things on the welcome page.
